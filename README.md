# Test Shader01
Hey!

This is a repo containing **my first** time working with shaders and GLSL code :)

I have been wanting to experiment with hardware accelerated, and parallel processing on the GPU since I began creative coding as the many shaders and visual effects possible are a **huge** inspiration!

## Many Thanks! ##
To the ***wonderful*** artists doing research into the field and sharing their work !
*I will add to this file as I commit the repo*
